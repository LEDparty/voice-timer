# About

This timer is interactive and contains multiple options.
You can countdown time based on a point in the future or
set amount of seconds, minutes, and hours passed. When time
runs out, your computer makes a phonetic noise, shouts
a reminder, or issues a command! You can choose the
message. You can can also use the -i option in order
to run it like a stopwatch (indefinite).
